# Space_Simulator
 
Hello! This is my first ever game created in Unity in addition to my first experience developing in C#. This is an N-body space simulation, able to calculate the force of gravity between N bodies in real time, with the upper limit of N being limited by your CPU!

In this simulation there are unmoving stars (the sun), planet's in set orbits, planet's in simulation decided orbits, moon's for orbiting planets, random meteors/asteroids and of course the player's spacecraft. If not in orbit, these objects are placed arbitrarily in the simulation with a given position and velocity allowing it's surrounding gravitional bodies to decide their trajectory.

In the clip below you can see the player's spacecraft orbiting the local sun with a planet and moon system also orbiting this same sun.
